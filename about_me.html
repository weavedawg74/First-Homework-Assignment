	<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
	<p>I am from Houston, TX and work at Wunderman Data Management. I spent 6 years in the U.S. Army from 2007 to 2013. While in the Army I learned how to read, write , and speak Arabic. I also lived in Vilseck, Germany and spent a year in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p>While in Germany i was able to travel to quite a few different places:
		<ul>
			<li>Germany</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Munich</li>
					<li>Hamburg</li>
					<li>Berlin</li>
					<li>Nuremburg</li>
					<li>Edelweis</li>
					<li>Neuschwanstein Castle</li>
				</ul>				
			<li>Greece</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Athens</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Italy</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rome</li>
					<li>Florence</li>
					<li>Pisa</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Czechoslovakia</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Prague</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Turkey</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Ephesus</li>
				</ul>
			<li>France</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Paris</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Poland</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Auschwitz</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Being able to hop on a train and travel was probably the coolest thing I've experienced and it allowed me to go to many more places than I'd have ever thought. </br> 
	Without a doubt, my favorite place I visted was Rome. I spent so much time there and still felt like there a more to see. I could spend a whole week just going to 
	the Vatican and looking at what all they have in the museum. I also loved the Trevi Fountain, It's gorgeous and if you go at the right time of the day the tourists aren't 
	surrounding it yet and it is quite relaxing and serene.
